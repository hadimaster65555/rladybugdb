[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

`rladybugdb` binds directly to the
[LadybugDB](https://github.com/LadybugDB/ladybug) C API through Rcpp. LadybugDB,
formerly known as Kuzu, runs in the R process: no Python or server is needed.
The package supports the engine's Cypher query language without claiming
conformance beyond the behavior tested here.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("hadimaster65555/rladybugdb")
```

During installation, the configure script selects the LadybugDB 0.20.4
artifact for the current operating system and CPU, verifies its published
SHA-256 checksum, and compiles the package against the matching header. macOS
and Linux use the upstream static archive. Windows installs the matching
LadybugDB DLL together with its checksum-verified OpenSSL 3 runtime DLLs.

```r
library(rladybugdb)
ladybugdb_version()
#> [1] "0.20.4"
```

## Quick start

```r
library(rladybugdb)

local({
db <- lb_database(":memory:") # use a file path for a persisted database
conn <- lb_connection(db)
on.exit({
  lb_close(conn)
  lb_close(db)
}, add = TRUE)

lb_close(lb_execute(
  conn,
  "CREATE NODE TABLE Person (name STRING, age INT64, PRIMARY KEY(name))"
))
lb_close(lb_execute(
  conn,
  "CREATE NODE TABLE City (name STRING, country STRING, PRIMARY KEY(name))"
))
lb_close(lb_execute(
  conn,
  "CREATE REL TABLE LivesIn (FROM Person TO City, since INT64)"
))

lb_close(lb_execute(
  conn,
  "CREATE (:Person {name: $name, age: $age})",
  parameters = list(name = "Alice", age = 30L)
))
lb_close(lb_execute(conn, "CREATE (:City {name: 'London', country: 'UK'})"))
lb_close(lb_execute(
  conn,
  paste(
    "MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Alice'}), (c:City {name: 'London'})",
    "CREATE (p)-[:LivesIn {since: 2018}]->(c)"
  )
))

lb_query(
  conn,
  paste(
    "MATCH (p:Person)-[:LivesIn]->(c:City)",
    "RETURN p.name AS person, c.name AS city, p.age AS age"
  )
)
#>   person   city age
#> 1  Alice London  30
})
```

`with_lb_connection()` is a compact alternative when a connection should be
scoped to one expression.

## Query results and streaming

`lb_execute()` returns an explicit result object. Materializing or printing it
does not consume its streaming cursor, and result objects can be closed more
than once safely.

```r
result <- lb_execute(conn, "UNWIND range(1, 100000) AS id RETURN id")
on.exit(lb_close(result), add = TRUE)

print(result, n = 5)          # bounded, non-consuming preview
first <- lb_fetch(result, 1000)
second <- lb_fetch(result, 1000)
lb_reset(result)
info <- lb_result_info(result)
timing <- lb_query_summary(result)
```

`lb_next_result()` exposes subsequent results from a multi-statement query.
`lb_set_timeout()` and `lb_interrupt()` control long-running work, while
`lb_begin()`, `lb_commit()`, and `lb_rollback()` provide transaction control.

## Arrow and bulk loading

When `arrow` is installed, results move through the Arrow C Data Interface
without first becoming an R data frame. Fetching can be bounded by batch size.

```r
table <- as_arrow_table(result)
batch <- lb_fetch_arrow(result, n = 10000)
```

`lb_copy_from_arrow()` registers an Arrow object as an in-memory LadybugDB
table and copies it into an existing node table. `lb_copy_from_df()` uses this
path when Arrow is available and warns before using its lower-fidelity CSV
fallback. `lb_copy_from_csv()` remains the explicit file-oriented loader.
Identifiers, file paths, delimiters, and COPY options are validated and quoted.

## DBI

The package retains its graph-specific `lb_*` interface and also provides a
DBI backend.

```r
local({
dbi_conn <- DBI::dbConnect(Ladybug(), dbname = ":memory:", bigint = "character")
on.exit(DBI::dbDisconnect(dbi_conn), add = TRUE)

DBI::dbExecute(
  dbi_conn,
  "CREATE NODE TABLE Item (id INT64, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(id))"
)
DBI::dbGetQuery(dbi_conn, "RETURN $id AS id", params = list(id = 1L))
})
```

DBI table methods operate on LadybugDB node and relationship tables. Graph
schema and traversal remain available directly through Cypher. This is a
Cypher backend, so SQL `SELECT` strings and relational `dbWriteTable()` /
`dbAppendTable()` assumptions do not apply; create graph tables with Cypher and
load them with the `lb_copy_*()` functions. LadybugDB does not currently expose
a stable affected-row count through its C result summary, so `dbExecute()`
returns `0` after successful DDL/DML. The compatible DBI driver contract is
covered by a focused DBItest subset.

## Type mapping

| LadybugDB type | Default R representation |
|---|---|
| BOOL | `logical` |
| INT8 / INT16 / INT32 | `integer` |
| INT64 / SERIAL | `double` |
| UINT32 / FLOAT / DOUBLE | `double` |
| INT128 / DECIMAL | exact `character` |
| STRING / UUID / JSON | `character` |
| DATE | `Date` |
| TIMESTAMP variants | `POSIXct` in UTC |
| BLOB | a `raw` vector in a list column |
| INTERVAL | structured `lb_interval` value |
| LIST / ARRAY | list column |
| MAP / STRUCT / UNION | structured list value |
| NODE / REL / RECURSIVE_REL | structured graph value |
| NULL | type-appropriate `NA` or `NULL` in a list column |

Set `options(rladybugdb.bigint = "character")` for exact character INT64 and
UINT64 results, or use `"integer64"` with the optional `bit64` package for
signed INT64. UINT64 remains character in `integer64` mode because `bit64` has
no unsigned representation. The default `"double"` mode is convenient but is
only exact through 2^53.

R parameters support logical, integer, double, character, factors, `Date`,
`POSIXct`, `bit64::integer64`, raw bytes, lists, and named lists. Every typed R
missing scalar binds as database `NULL`. Raw values use LadybugDB's documented
STRING-to-BLOB cast, so use them in a BLOB-typed context or `CAST($value AS
BLOB)`.

## Graph conversion and extensions

`as_igraph()` and `as_tbl_graph()` convert returned NODE, REL, and recursive
path values while preserving labels, properties, isolated nodes, and exact
internal identifiers.

Extension helpers are deliberately thin wrappers:

```r
lb_list_extensions(conn)
install_result <- lb_install_extension(conn, "algo")
lb_close(install_result)
load_result <- lb_load_extension(conn, "algo")
lb_close(load_result)
```

See `vignette("extensions", package = "rladybugdb")` for PageRank, Louvain,
BM25 full-text search, HNSW vector search, and data interoperability examples.

## Stored databases and offline builds

LadybugDB 0.20.4 reads the storage format written by the previously bundled
0.15.x engine; this is covered by a committed compatibility fixture. Back up a
database before opening it with a new engine. See
`vignette("storage-migration", package = "rladybugdb")` for migration and
recovery steps.

For an offline build, pre-populate the platform artifacts while network access
is available, then build and install from the resulting source tree:

```r
Rscript tools/vendor.R
R CMD INSTALL .
```

The pinned version is stored in `tools/lbug_version`; checksums are in
`tools/lbug_checksums`. A clean source archive excludes downloaded and compiled
artifacts and retrieves the verified platform artifact during installation.

Runnable package examples are installed under `inst/examples`.
